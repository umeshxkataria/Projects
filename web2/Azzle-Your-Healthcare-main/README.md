# Azzle-Your-Healthcare
💊 Azzle – Your AI Health Companion
Azzle is an intelligent, chatbot-powered health assistant designed to guide users through basic medical queries, symptom checks, and mental wellness support — not to replace doctors, but to offer accessible, informed, and immediate help when it’s needed most.

🧠 What It Does
Interacts with users in natural language to understand health concerns.

Provides first-level suggestions based on symptoms.

Offers mental health and emergency advice.

Ensures responses are informative, empathetic, and non-diagnostic.

🧰 Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

AI Model: ClinicalBERT from HuggingFace – fine-tuned on real-world medical data (MIMIC-III) & Gemini APi

Deployment: Netlify for website & Vercel for CHATBOT

Dataset Insights: Utilizes medically validated datasets for accuracy and context, with a focus on practical healthcare scenarios.

🚫 Limitations
Not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Designed for awareness and support, not for prescriptions or critical diagnosis.

🎯 Why Azzle?
We built Azzle to bridge the information gap between panic-googling symptoms and speaking to a real doctor. With powerful AI like ClinicalBERT, we provide contextual and relevant insights — especially for users in low-access environments or who need immediate mental health support.
