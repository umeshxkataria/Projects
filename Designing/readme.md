# 🎨 designing/

> Not every line of creativity is code. Sometimes it’s Figma.

This folder is home to my visual mind — UI/UX ideas, wireframes, design systems, motion studies, and anything else where pixels speak louder than functions.

## 🖼️ What You’ll Find

- 🧩 Figma files for apps, dashboards, and landing pages  
- 🔁 Design system foundations: spacing, grids, typography  
- 🎬 Motion concepts & interaction demos (Lottie, Framer, etc.)  
- 🎯 Prompt-based explorations & AI-augmented compositions  
- 🎭 UI clones, dark mode experiments, layout challenges

## 🧠 Why This Exists

> Design isn’t just how it looks — it’s how it feels, flows, and behaves.  
This folder captures that process. The rough sketches, the flashes of brilliance, the late-night design dopamine.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Most files are `.fig`, `.pdf`, or embedded in PNG/GIF previews  
- Some designs are fully responsive — some are just vibe-locked  
- Feedback is always welcome. So are remix requests

---

> 🎨 designing/ — where pixels get purpose, and flows get form.
