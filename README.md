# 🧠 Projects Vault

> Coffee without coffee? That’s what a project repo without structure is.  
> This is where all the chaos gets organized.

forks, clones, half-baked ideas, full-stack apps — all in one wild jungle.

Now? Welcome to my **Projects Vault** — a clean structure where every build has a home.
