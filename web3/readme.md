# 🌐 Web3 Playground

> Not just apps — these are experiments on-chain.  
> Welcome to my decentralized build lab.

This folder is dedicated to everything **Web3** —  
from writing smart contracts to building complete decentralized applications.

Forks, stacks, side quests — all now under one roof, neatly structured.

## 🧠 What's Inside

- **Smart Contracts** — Solidity-based contracts deployed on testnets
- **dApps** — Full-stack decentralized apps using Ethers.js or Web3.js
- **NFT Tools** — Custom minting logic, metadata scripts, NFT storefronts
- **Wallet / DeFi Utilities** — Experiments around wallets, gas fees, swaps, and interactions with protocols
